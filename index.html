The longhouse also offers overnight stays, with visitors accompanying the locals in their daily activities, such as padi planting and fishing.</p> <p>From: https://sarawaktourism.com/attraction/bawang-assan-iban-longhouses/</p>',

Despite how old the establishment is, Rumah Nyuka is proudly approved by the Ministry of Tourism in Malaysia. You might be wondering how many people actually live here. In total, it houses 300 people from 45 families.There are also plenty of activities to do during your stay. The locals are more than happy to guide you through jungle trekking and swimming at the waterfalls nearby. If you want to try something a bit different, you can even be a dabai collector or rubber tapper for the day."

		  "content":"Bawang Assan is an Iban settlement of 9 longhouses dating from the 18th Century, about 40 minutes from Sibu by boat or road. It is particularly appealing to visitors for two reasons; firstly the longhouses range from the very traditional to the quite modern, so visitors can get a good idea of how longhouses have evolved to keep pace with the times; and secondly, many of the older inhabitants can speak excellent English and are therefore superb interpreters of their culture.  The longhouse also offers overnight stays, with visitors accompanying the locals in their daily activities, such as padi planting and fishing."
