The longhouse also offers overnight stays, with visitors accompanying the locals in their daily activities, such as padi planting and fishing.</p> <p>From: https://sarawaktourism.com/attraction/bawang-assan-iban-longhouses/</p>',

It takes nine months to mature and flowering lasts only 4 or 5 days before dying. Owing to the rafflesia’s rarity and brief flowering period, timing (and luck) are important. The park staff usually know when a plant is about to bloom. Visitors can check with the park HQ (Tel: +60 82 735144) or the National Parks and Wildlife Booking Office in Kuching (Tel: +60 82 248088) to find out if any plants are about to bloom or already in bloom. Although flowers generally bloom throughout the year, November, December and January can be regarded as the peak flowering season as the frequency of blooms is high."
